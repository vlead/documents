* Cloud Infrastructure Requirements
   
  The paper will briefly outline the insfrastructure needs for the 
  Virtual Labs Engineering and Architecture Division (VLEAD)


** Hosting Environment
   
   VLEAD is central platform engineering team for the virtual labs project. 
   The primary goal is provide a uniform platform for all the virtual labs to
   run from. 
   
   These labs seen as a collection of web applications interact with a common
   set of services developed by VLEAD and residing on the cloud.

   Each of these labs and services will run from an individual virtual
   machine. Currently, these are running from VLEAD infrastructure, but to reap 
   the benefits of cloud - availability, scalability among many - the same will 
   be migrated to cloud. The below figure depicts the stack when migrated to cloud.

** Requirements
  
*** Resource requirements 
   There are about 140 virtual labs each of which can be hosted in a separate
   VM.  Other possibility is to create large VMs where labs will be hosted in
   separate containers.  Either way VMs or containers will be used for isolation
   among labs.  For labs and various lab services, we foresee requirement of
   about 150 VMs with varying resources.  Each of these VMs would need resources
   ranging from 2 GB RAM to even upwards of 16GB RAM per VM.

   Labs that are intensive in processing would need more CPU cores and probably
   more RAM than labs that serve static pages.  Popularity of a lab will also
   determine the resource allocation to the VM or the container from which it
   runs.

   Since the exact resource requirements of the lab cannot be
   predicted, VLEAD is counting on scalability and dynamic resource
   allocation capabilities of the cloud.

   For dynamic scheduling of resources for lab based on the usage, virtual
   machines are the only bet, unless VLEAD develops it's own elastic mechanism
   for the containers.


*** API Requirements
    We need the cloud to support management of VMs (creation, termination,
    reboot, etc.) through an API or command-line interface.  This is necessary
    as we plan to make the entire setup as automated as possible.  It should be
    possible for the system to create new VMs and deploy new version of a lab on
    a new VM without requiring human intervention.
   
    Further, we are also looking for external resource monitoring through base
    machine in terms of CPU usage, disk usage, network usage, etc.  This is
    required to detect, if VM is hanged or crashed without depending on a local
    agent running inside VM.
